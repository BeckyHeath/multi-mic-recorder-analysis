## Exploring MAARU Localisation Accuracy and Persistance in the Field

### General Audio Tools

These scripts are for general audio editing, with adjustments for 6 channel audio. 

#### Scripts written for this repo: 

FLAC_to_wav.py => just changes FLAC files back to wav



#### Scripts used in this work but taken from elsewhere:

getfn.m => from Thorsten.Hansesn@psychol.uni-giessen.de, gets filenames from directories and subdirectories\
tight_subplot.m => from Pekka Kumpulainen, allows you to customise subplotes easier \
patchline.m => from MathWorks, data visualisation tool


### Signal Quality 

#### Visualisation
spectraDevComparisonrerejigm.m => Channel Specific Spectra from all 4 Devices, this is the big spectra figure that shows dignal degredation. \
spectaBatch.m => generates spectral figures, channel specifically, from ALL of the field recording files plots them per period, per channel \
test_signal_comparisson.m => comapre two spectra \
plot_all.m => Plots spectra from a list of files, looks like it has some issues but still good. \
Sweep_Analysis_single_degredation.m => Compares channel-wise spectra of two recordings\

#### Checking and ammending problems
deadSigDetection.m => Determine signal strength of each channel compared to eachother\
addGain.m => Takes output files from deadSigDetection.m and adjusts the channel specific gain accordingly\
metaDesc.m => Looks like a function for attributing qualiatative values to channel powers

##### Mixed Power Recordings (Detection and Fixing): 
use the "deadsigdetection.m" script to generate the raw mean(abs) data + the corresponding text descriptions, 
then used gainAdjust.m to bump the gain?

### Localisation Accuracy 

Angle_Dif_LocalisationPre.R => Analysing Pre Deployment Localisations (just angle differences now!)\
Angle_Dif_LocalisationPost.R => Analysing Post Deployment Localisations (just angle differences now!)\
Lab_Localisation_Analysis.R => generates the first localisation figures \
localisation_data_extraction.py => pulls out important info from HARKBird outputs 

### Recording Hours

MetadataGrapher.r => Consolidates upload information, files generated manually/ from a file generated by MetadataFromBoxADD_OWN_DETAILS.m. Generates hours of daily upload figure. \
MetadataFromBoxADD_OWN_DETAILS.m => This downloads all your file info from github but requires you putting in password etc\
NotForGithub.m => NOT VISIBLE, just ftp info for Matlab\
NotForGithub.r => ftp settings but for R 

### Power Consumption Info
Power_stats.r => Stats and Figures on the power consumption data
